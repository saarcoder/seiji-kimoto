  "intro_text": "On the occasion of the annual commemoration for the victims of concentration camp Loibl on June 11th, Borut Sajovic, mayor of Tržič, opened Seiji Kimoto's Moč in nemoč (Power and Powerlessness) exhibition in the Pavilion of National Liberation. The exhibition was organized by the Museum of Tržič and was open to the public until the 10th of July. It was supported by the city of Tržič, the Slovenian Ministry of Culture and the Saarland Ministry of Education and Culture.",
  "body_text": "Front and center of the exhibition was the newly created sculpture \"Breakthrough\" commemorating the victims of the concentration camp Loibl. The sculpture shows two human silhouettes, seemingly ingrown into a rock-like, split relief. In her opening remarks, Ursula Kimoto stressed the importance of vividly addressing particularly younger people through art, as the youth lack immediate access to the collective memory, and fewer and fewer Holocaust survivors were able to bear witness. As art in itself was not so much concerned with knowledge and information, as it was with internalization and com-passion, it had a specific purpose in our times of renewed threats of fundamental democratic values, and, in a very unique way, was able to forge a bridge to a future of humanity.",

  "body2_text": "In a memorial service for the victims of the Loibl concentration camps former Slovenian President Milan Kucan also focussed on the context of the Europe-wide rise of right-wing parties and the increase of right-wing violence for remembrance work, and pleaded for a peaceful Europe. He called for us to \"reject hostility and the displays of national self-interest\", as \"we are obliged to protest the lack of sensitivity and the loss of historical memory. Because we want to realize the idea of a united and free Europe. Because we want to give space to the civilization of peace, to tolerance, acceptance and mutual respect.\"",
