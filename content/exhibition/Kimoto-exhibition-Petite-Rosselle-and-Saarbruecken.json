    "intro_text": "In a joint Franco-German exhibition organized by Stiftung Demokratie Saarland and Parc Explor Wendel, sculptures and ink paintings by Kimoto will be shown in France and Germany. Starting in France in a former coal laundry of mine \"La Mine Wendel\" in Petite-Rosselle from the 15th of June 2018, select sculptures by Kimoto will be exhibited in the setting of the hard work of miners underground. The exhibition will be on display until the 15th of August in the last French mine under the title \"Human shadow - L'ombre des hommes\". Afterwards, from October 19, 2018 to January 11, 2019, at the Political Academy Saarbrücken, a follow-up show of ink drawings by Kimoto will be presented, to guide us carefully to the center of injustice that is the theme of Kimoto's works, says exhibition manager Dr. Verena Paul from SDS Saarbrücken. The exhibition partners aim to show us the common goals of Germany and France in dealing with the history of the 20th century.",
