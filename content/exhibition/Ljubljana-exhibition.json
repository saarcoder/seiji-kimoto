  "intro_text": "As part of the general programme of the 2nd Festival of Tolerance in Ljubljana, Seiji Kimoto's Moč in nemoč (Power and Powerlessness) exhibition has been shown in Ljubljana Town Hall from February 25th to March 28th, 2016. The festival originated in Ljubljana from an initiative of concentration camp survivor and multiple Oscar winner Branko Lustig on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2015. Its main intent is to promote tolerance as the basic building block of modern, civilized societies, and to raise awareness of a lack of tolerance towards marginalized groups in our time, on the basis of the experience of the Holocaust.",

Its film presentations alone have been seen by over 100,000 visitors already. The 2nd Festival of Tolerance in Ljubljana was staged under the patronage of the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, and was organized by Mini Teater Ljubljana and the Jewish Cultural Center Ljubljana in cooperation with JFF Zagreb.",
