  "intro_text": "In its basic form the model \"Star in Motion\" by Seiji Kimoto is a modified Star of David split into two halves. The concept behind the model is the distortion of the Star of David during the Holocaust, when it was used as a mark for discriminating and humiliating people and became a carte blanche for destruction and murder: the Star broken apart into two halves. However, the absolute will to destroy is countered here by the power of the victims and the righteous, who brace themselves against annihilation. Symbolically they re-erect the six-pointed star, restoring its original form and completing it.",

  "body_text": "The figurative elements: for one, there is the hexagon, broken apart into two triangles - a destruction of the Star of David, suggesting the attempted violent annihilation of the Jewish people. The tip of the upright triangle is facing rearwards, and deliberately kept in red, symbolizing the applied force, the suffering, but also life and its invincible dignity. The semi-recumbent, upwards bent triangle is hinting at resistance and the power of resistance - not only of the victims, but also of the righteous people coming to their rescue, the power of resistance against despotism and against the will to kill."
