  "intro_text": "More than 200,000 people from various countries in Europe were brought to the main camp of Mauthausen, Austria, and imprisoned here by the SS and the Wehrmacht. Those who were not killed immediately, mostly died within a few days, weeks or months from torture, disease, hunger and the inhuman drudgery in the quarries and tunnels. Their sufferings and deaths and the cynically indifferent cruelty of their murderers are unimaginable for us today. They were slain in the quarries and shot while fleeing, hanged and drowned, suffocated in the gas chambers and killed by petrol injections into their hearts. In order to keep the memory of the people and their sufferings alive, Seiji Kimoto has shown his exhibition \"Power and Powerlessness - People, Traces, Shadows\" here from September 11th to November 10th, 2006. The exhibition was organized by the Federal Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Austria.",
  "body_text": "We are facing the ruins of the gas chambers and detention cells, the torture and murder weapons, the quarry and the abandoned sleeping quarters of the victims and feel the breath of death, which will not leave this place ever again. But the people themselves have disappeared and our memories of them are fading. Reflections of the larger contexts like the search for causes and reasons are sidelining personal memories. We try to understand and to explain, and in this process the individuals are becoming history and history is turning into a moral responsibility for the future. The sculptures \"Power and Powerlessness\" of sculptor and painter Seiji Kimoto from Germany are trying to reduce the gap that has arisen from the passage of time and the succession of generations. At four stations on the grounds of the former concentration camp and inside the visitor center, large human figures made of wood have been set up at the places of suffering and death of so many people, to let us remember the people in a moment of standstill, to connect to them in their despair and to pay them our last respects.",

The ones who were brought here - at least since January 1st of 1941 - were provisioned to be quashed by heavy labor. This way, their murders were even earning the SS thousandfold profit, and sometimes they were literally forced to produce the weapons used for conducting the German war against the world. For the young and able-bodied prisoners internment meant to mine heavy granite blocks from the quarries of Mauthausen for the construction of the planned \"Fuhrer city Linz\", and to haul them on their backs over the 186 steep steps high \"Stairs of Death\" up to the camp. Many fell down to their deaths there, children and young people alike, and in the course of this often dragged others to death as well - for the amusement of the SS thugs below them. And the ones whose strength failed them to reach the top of the stairs were forced to jump into the abyss by the SS, or shot while fleeing.",

The outdoor sculpture \"Reminder\" similarly shows a scene with a human figure trying to ward off an apparently inevitable fate by keeping up the ridge beam of a collapsing house with all her strength - a symbol of the defencelessness of the victims of the SS, the breakdown of their past lives, and the gradual disappearance of our memories of them.",

Like these sculptures, the three figures of the group \"Load\" exist in no more than two dimensions and cannot stand by themselves anymore. They represent how the structures of the camp completely determined the daily lives of the prisoners: the more than hard work, the appeals and the marching, the life behind the barbed wire and the constant hustle, the lack of sleep, illness and hunger, abandonment and the never-ending struggle for survival, the smoke in the ovens and the ever-increasing number of new arrivals.",
