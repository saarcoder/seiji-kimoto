The exhibition was opened by the Upper Palatinate Government President Dr. Wilhelm Weidinger on July 29th, with a special greeting by Diocesan Bishop Dr. Gerhard Ludwig Müller, patron of the exhibition.

The exhibition ended with a panel discussion between government President Weidinger, Lisa Unger-Fischer from Europaeum, former Vice-President of the European Parliament Gerhard Schmid and Pavel Liška from Art Forum East German Gallery on October 17th, 2004.
