  "intro_text": "In an essay for the Power and Powerlessness exhibition in the Dominican Church Regensburg, Dr. Friedrich Fuchs of the episcopal art collections tries to understand Kimoto's work from the perspective of his Japanese origins. \"Seiji Kimoto lived in Germany for decades. (...) Has he become a German artist by now? Or do pervasive roots in the (...) culture of Japan still exist in his art? (...) The deep, almost unfathomably dense symbolism of Japanese art always fascinated modernity. Art history classified the aforementioned artists as \"symbolists\". Their imagery is enormously expressive and extraordinarily concentrated thematically, wrestling with the fundamental questions of human existence. Broadly speaking, Seiji Kimoto's artistic direction could well be characterized in the same manner.\"",
  "body_text": "\"He has internalized the bandwidth of European modernity, but also remained Japanese. In parts of his work he carries forward the development of the visual language of German expressionism, the force of large compact forms or of striking surface structures and distinctive color planes. His preference for surrealism is evident as well. In total, however, he always sticks close to the familiar image of man, even in his few abstract sculptures. (...) The central topic of his work is the human being torn apart in the stress field of power and powerlessness. The artist's compassion is with the powerless. In his sculptures, he translates their outer and inner being, their needs and their rescue attempts into images of man.\"",

  "body2_text": "\"Many of Seiji Kimoto's sculptures are still and steady outwardly, without sweeping gestures, but heavy and even forceful in their physical presence, although talking first and foremost of conditions of impotence. Their lament is mostly silent, but of shattering intensity. Yet deep inside a great resilience shines through forebodingly. Partly this is also felt on the outside in the clarity and unshakeable strength of the form. (...) Despite the dark gloom cast upon them, an internal balance of Buddha statues seems to be palpable, and also a calligraphic trait adheres to them.\"",

  "body3_text": "\"The details are put down sparingly and purposefully: the frequently used strings or pieces of strong ropes, chunky boulders, lattice structures of bulky intact or nervously shattered forms. Graphically charged surfaces prevail, smooth, wrinkled, or rutted wood treated roughly with a chisel, covered with strong earthy colors between deep brown and glowing red. Seiji Kimoto is a sculptor and calligrapher. This can be sensed particularly in the abstract works, but also in those human figures dissolving into images of ecstatic contours. Basically, these sculptures are plastic calligraphy.\"",
