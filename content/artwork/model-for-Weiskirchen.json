  "intro_text": "At the invitation of the municipality of Weiskirchen, Seiji Kimoto attended a competition for the artistic design of a traffic circle within the community in December 1994. The contest was conducted by State Development Corporation Saar. His design was unanimously awarded the first prize by the jury in March 1995, as \"this design is closest to the theme for the design of the inner circle with its sculpture of the spa resort. The very transparent and filigree abstracting design of a fountain in this form is very appealing, engaging the senses and easily understood by every citizen.\" For unknown reasons, the order for realizing the steel sculpture was never issued by the municipality of Weiskirchen.",
