  "intro_text": "End of March 2009 Seiji Kimoto set up an \"Open Studio\" in the foyer of Technical School for Design Saarbrücken. Interested young designers were invited to observe and accompany Kimoto for 52 days while he was creating a new sculpture from scratch, shaping an original form in many individual steps. Following this creative act the installation, named \"orientation\" at the suggestion of the students, was handed over to the Technical-Commercial Vocational Training Centre Saarbrücken on June 29th, 2009. The project was supported by the Ministry of Education, Family, Women and Culture of the Saarland, the Saarland Sport Toto GmbH and Association Ramesch.",
