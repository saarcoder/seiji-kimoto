  "intro_text": "\"Say no!\" is the title of an installation created by Seiji Kimoto for Geschwister-Scholl school Blieskastel at the initiative of Adolf-Bender Center St. Wendel. It was named after a legacy appeal by writer Wolfgang Borchert from 1947, which gained wider popularity in the German peace movement after World War II. Guided by their history teacher Barbara Montenarh, the students had been looking into the lives and times of their school's namesakes, Hans and Sophie Scholl, from German resistance group \"The White Rose\" in the era of National Socialism for more than a year. Then they thought of ways to let their schoolmates benefit from their research as well, an endeavour that resulted in a joint project with Michael Groß, Katharina Klasen and Jonas Kruthoff from St. Wendel's Adolf-Bender Center, and finally with Seiji Kimoto, whom the students visited in June when working on the installation in his Wiebelskirchen studio.",
  "body_text": "Their cooperative youth project resulted in a large-size exhibition wall on the lives and activities of the White Rose group in its historical context, which found it's place in the foyer of their school. The memorial wall displays a larger than life portrayal of the Scholl siblings under the motto from Sophie Scholl that \"... it is gutless to just turn away\", and furthermore a historical timeline, as well as portrays of other members of the White Rose group. On the right side, it is flanked by pictures of the study group's members and quotes of the main points they took away from their research on the bold and brave fight of the White Rose, for their and for our lives today. Facing the exhibition wall, Kimoto's sculpture \"Say no!\" engages in a kind of dialog with the Scholl siblings' portrayals. It reveals the spiritual man within man's bodily existence, his resilience and dignity, which surmounts all constraints and violations. The sculpture's main aim: to provide the pupils with an inner connecting factor with the Scholl siblings, above the separation of times.",

  "body2_text": "Along with the exhibition wall made by the pupils and Adolf-Bender Center, the sculpture was handed over to the public in a school ceremony on September 30, 2016, on the invitation of school principle Sylvia Behet. The Minister of Education of the Saarland, Ulrich Commerçon, and District Councilor Dr. Theophil Gallo, as well as managing director of Adolf-Bender Center, Willi Portz, emphasized the demanding commitment implicit in the school's naming, and concluded that the dedicated initiative of the pupils was meeting this obligation in an exemplary manner. As the Scholl siblings had demonstrated impressively, Commerçon observed, a school never is or was a place free of social and political issues, but instead is a place where freedom, democracy and tolerance need to be lived, and to be fought for, now and then.",

It is crucial that any person is allowed to decide freely as to how she or he wants to live. Nobody ought to be disparaged, just because he choses to take a path in life different from others.\" The exhibition wall and the school sculpture have been sponsored by the Saar-Palatinate District, the government of the Saarland, and Adolf-Bender Center.",
