  "intro_text": "Beneath a large chestnut tree in the garden of St. John's Church in the center of Saarbrücken, on the side facing downtown, a steel sculpture by Seiji Kimoto entitled \"Resistance - Abandonment\" has been set up in 2010. Passengers heading towards the town hall and the city center  come along here. Its location was deliberately chosen to allow the sculpture to impact the public realm from the church, says Regine Eichholz from Project St. John's Church. After the exhibition \"Power and Powerlessness\" in St. John's Church, Seiji Kimoto contributed the sculpture as a permanent loan to the parish.",
