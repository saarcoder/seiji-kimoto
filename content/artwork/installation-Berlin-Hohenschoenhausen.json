  "intro_text": "Political dissidents, misfits, disgruntled young people, or the so-called \"Republic refugees\" trying to escape East Germany - the list of prisoners at the central detention center of the State Security of the GDR was long and arbitrary. They were kidnapped, isolated and subjected to endless torments, applied to break their will. Without them knowing, their place of torture was in the middle of Berlin, in the district of Hohenschönhausen. In order to remember the many people who had to endure the excessive power and the arbitrariness of the former East German State Security here, Seiji Kimoto showed his exhibition \"Power and Powerlessness\" from September 2003 until January 2004 in the former cellar prison of the memorial. Following the exhibition, the installation \"human material\" was handed over to Berlin-Hohenschönhausen memorial. It remained accessible to visitors there, up until the start of extensive remediation works in the basement of the older prison construction in 2011. Currently a new installation site is being sought.",
