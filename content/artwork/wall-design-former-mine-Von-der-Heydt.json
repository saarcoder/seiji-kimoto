  "intro_text": "For a period of more than 8 decades from 1850 on, miners went down underground here in the pit of mine Von der Heydt in the \"coal forest\" of Saarbr√ºcken. Following the end of coal mining many inhabitants left the settlement. Left to herself nature is gaining ground again, and today state forestry company SaarForst has moved into the preserved bedroom houses of the miners. In the preserved ancient sanctuary of the mine's Catholic chapel Seiji Kimoto devoted a wall installation titled \"circuits\" to the memories of the life and work of the miners, of the exploitation of nature by man, and of the recovering nature.",
